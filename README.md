# Sajeclan Gunshot Detection API

This API detects gunshots in uploaded audio files using machine learning and sends alerts via Telegram when a gunshot is detected. The model is based on the `opensoundscape` library and utilizes a pre-trained ResNet18 binary classification model to predict the presence of gunshots.

## Installation

This project uses Python 3.8+ (specifically Python 3.10) and Poetry for dependency management.

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sajeclan-gunshot-detection-api.git
cd sajeclan-gunshot-detection-api
```

### Install dependencies:

First, ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed on your system. Then, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all the dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file, including the machine learning libraries, FastAPI, and Telegram bot integration.

## Setup

### Pre-trained Model

Before you can start detecting gunshots, you need to have the pre-trained model saved in `app/model/best.model`. Place your model file in this directory.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
TELEGRAM_SAJE_BOT_TOKEN=<your_telegram_bot_token>
TELEGRAM_ANTI_POACHING_GROUP_CHAT_ID=<your_group_chat_id>
```

These variables are required for the Telegram bot integration to send alerts.

## Usage

### Running the API

To start the FastAPI server, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This will start the API server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Or run in virtual environment with Poetry:

```bash
poetry shell
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Endpoints

### `GET /`

Returns a simple health check response to ensure the API is running.

- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "200": "OK"
  }
  ```

### `POST /detect`

Uploads an audio file and runs it through the gunshot detection model.

- **Request:** A file upload (`multipart/form-data`)
  - `file`: The audio file to be analyzed. Must be a WAVE file (.WAV)
- **Response:** JSON response indicating the result of the detection.

  - If a gunshot is detected, a message is sent to the configured Telegram group.

- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "results": "Wildlife Rescue Team! I detected a Gunshot. Probability: 82.45%"
  }
  ```

## Environment Variables

The project relies on the following environment variables:

- **TELEGRAM_SAJE_BOT_TOKEN**: Your Telegram bot's API token for sending messages.
- **TELEGRAM_ANTI_POACHING_GROUP_CHAT_ID**: The chat ID of the group to which gunshot alerts will be sent.

Make sure these variables are set correctly in the `.env` file.
